# SCRUD-CS ︻デ═一
SCRUD for Counter Strike

[The SCRUD System Using jQuery, JSON and the DataTables Plug-in by Jorrit Diepstraten on SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-a-scrud-system-using-jquery-json-and-datatables/). The acronym SCRUD refers to the basic manipulation functions that the user needs to work with the available data: Search, Create, Read, Update and Delete.

Originally, I used this SCRUD system for a university project and decided to change it a bit based around the computer game Counter Strike Source and Counter Strike Global Offensive. Basically this web application empowers the user to search a database and fully manage its content.


## Requirements

1. Prior knowledge of [PhpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) and/or SQL.
2. [Wampserver](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or an actual MySql database hosted on their own server.
3. Happiness! :smile:
