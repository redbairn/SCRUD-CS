# SCRUD-CS ︻デ═一
SCRUD for Counter Strike

The SCRUD System Using jQuery, JSON and the DataTables Plug-in. The acronym SCRUD refers to the basic manipulation functions that the user needs to work with the available data: Search, Create, Read, Update and Delete.

Originally, I used this SCRUD system for a university project and decided to change it a bit based around the computer game Counter Strike Source and Counter Strike Global Offensive.
